# Learning next JS Framework #
I plan on starting freelancing after I master my Next JS framework for React JS. Since I have good skills in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript now I need to explore new technologies.

I really liked its routing features and the Image component so I am sharing the progress in this repository

## Here's my Plan to become a Full Stack developer:
- **Completed HTML, CSS and JavaScript recently and if we talk about the skills in these languages then I have intermediate level skills in them.**

- **While talking about CSS frameworks I opt for tailwindCSS because I just liked it and now I am good at the very basics needed, I am thinking of learning SAAS soon enough.**

- **Finished React JS library recently and have my hand on the basics of it yes I will explore it more once I goes through next JS cus why not Next JS that is super cool.**

- Complete my Next JS and Start freelancing.

- After that go for node JS to merge my front end to backened and that 
will be the start of my full stack carrier.

```javascript
window.alert('You are an idiot who thinks this plan will be successful')
console.log('I am that idiot bro')
console.log(```But bro my main aim is to become an Indie Game Developer,
for that I will need a nice laptop with and rtx card```)
